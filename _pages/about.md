I'm a Master’s student in Robotics at the [Minnesota Robotics Institute (MnRI)](https://cse.umn.edu/mnri), researching robotic perception and manipulation with [Prof. Karthik Desingh](https://www.karthikdesingh.com) at the [Robotics Perception and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io/), where we explore how robots can perceive, reason about, and interact with objects in human environments.

During my Bachelor's study in Mechanical Engineering at the Vellore Institute of Technology, I co-founded a independent robotics team “I-bax,” where we worked on projects that bridged hardware with intelligent systems. From building low-cost CNC and 3D printers to developing perception-based control systems and assistive devices, I gained hands-on experience in autonomy and interdisciplinary design through both academic and self-driven initiatives. 

My research interests lie in robot manipulation, robotic perception, robots in human-centered environments. I’m particularly focused on:
- **Learning from Human Demonstrations**: Developing methods for robots to generalize and adapt manipulation skills from human demonstrations.
- **Robotic Perception and Manipulation**: Integrating perception systems with robots' manipulation capabilities to enable robots to interact effectively with human environments.
- **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Creating robots that can collaborate with humans by adapting to feedback and improving their task execution through continuous learning.
